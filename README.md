# Akul Saxena – Academic Portfolio Site

This repository is a Hugo + Wowchemy starter tailored for graduate‑school applications.
It comes with:

* GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys to **GitHub Pages**.
* Pre‑configured config files (TOML) using the Wowchemy academic theme.
* Sample *About*, *Project*, and *Publication* pages to guide your content structure.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Rename this repo to <your-username>.github.io and push to GitHub.
# 2) Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (branch: `gh-pages`).
# 3) If Hugo isn’t on your machine, you can still edit markdown via the GitHub UI – CI handles builds.
# 4) Replace placeholder content & commit; site auto‑updates at https://<your-username>.github.io
```
